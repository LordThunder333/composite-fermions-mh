Jastrow Derivative file not included, as too large for Github. Can be found at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e4iLdqPZocUjBpYWN2c49_AC-LTROx1_/view?usp=sharing. 

It can also be generated using the attached files horner_polynomials.jl

All relevant functions to the spherical geometry are placed in spherical_geometry_utilities.jl.

Overlap sampler to be added later.
